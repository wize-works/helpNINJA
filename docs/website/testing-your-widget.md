## Basic Functionality Testing

### Widget Visibility and Loading
**Testing Widget Appearance:**
1. **Visit your website** in a new browser window
2. **Look for the chat widget** - Should appear within 2-3 seconds
3. **Check positioning** - Widget should be in the correct corner/position
4. **Verify branding** - Colors, logo, and styling should match your settings
5. **Test on multiple pages** - Ensure widget appears consistently

**What to Look For:**
- **Widget bubble is visible** and not hidden behind other elements
- **Colors match** your brand customization
- **Size is appropriate** for your website layout
- **Position doesn't interfere** with other website elements
- **Loading is smooth** without flickering or jumping

### Opening and Closing
**Testing Widget Interaction:**
1. **Click the widget bubble** - Should open smoothly
2. **Check chat window appearance** - All elements should load properly
3. **Test closing the widget** - Should close cleanly and return to bubble
4. **Reopen the widget** - Should remember conversation state
5. **Test minimize/maximize** - If available in your settings

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Smooth animations** when opening and closing
- **Chat window loads completely** with all elements visible
- **Conversation history preserved** when reopening
- **No JavaScript errors** in browser console

### Message Exchange
**Testing Basic Chat Functionality:**
1. **Type a test message** - "Hello, this is a test"
2. **Send the message** - Should appear in chat window immediately
3. **Wait for AI response** - Should receive response within a few seconds
4. **Send follow-up questions** - Test conversation flow
5. **Check message formatting** - Text, links, and formatting should display correctly

**Message Testing Examples:**
- **Simple greeting**: "Hello" or "Hi there"
- **Basic question**: "What are your business hours?"
- **Complex question**: "How do I troubleshoot login issues with two-factor authentication?"
- **Nonsense question**: "Purple elephants dancing" (tests error handling)

## Content and AI Testing

### Knowledge Base Accuracy
**Testing AI Response Quality:**
1. **Ask questions you know the answers to** - Verify AI gives correct information
2. **Test different phrasings** - Same question asked different ways
3. **Try edge cases** - Unusual or complex questions
4. **Check source citations** - If enabled, verify AI shows where it found information
5. **Rate responses** - Use thumbs up/down if available

**Suggested Test Questions:**
- **Basic company info**: "What are your contact hours?"
- **Product/service questions**: "How much does [your product] cost?"
- **Technical support**: "How do I reset my password?"
- **Policy questions**: "What is your return policy?"

### Response Accuracy Evaluation
**What Makes a Good AI Response:**

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- **Incorrect information** - AI gives wrong details about your business
- **Outdated content** - AI references old policies or discontinued products
- **Confusing responses** - Unclear or contradictory information
- **Too generic** - Responses that don't specifically address the question

### Escalation Testing
**Testing Human Handoff:**
1. **Ask a complex question** AI shouldn't be able to answer
2. **Request human help** - "Can I speak to a human?"
3. **Express frustration** - "This isn't helpful, I need real help"
4. **Check escalation notification** - Verify your team gets notified
5. **Test conversation handoff** - Ensure smooth transition to human agent

**Escalation Scenarios to Test:**
- **Billing disputes** - "I was charged incorrectly"
- **Complex technical issues** - Multi-step troubleshooting
- **Account-specific questions** - "What's the status of my order #12345?"
- **Emotional situations** - Frustrated or upset customers
