## Conversation Management

### Active Conversation Handling
**Managing Live Customer Interactions:**

**Joining Conversations:**
```
Human Agent Intervention Process:

When to Join:
• AI confidence drops below threshold (usually 70%)
• Customer expresses frustration or dissatisfaction
• Complex issue requiring human judgment
• Technical problem AI cannot resolve
• Customer specifically requests human help

How to Join:
1. Click "Join Conversation" from dashboard
2. Review conversation history and context
3. Introduce yourself to customer
4. Take control of conversation from AI
5. Resolve customer issue
6. Document resolution for future AI learning

Example Agent Introduction:
"Hi [Customer Name], I'm [Agent Name] from helpNINJA support. I've been following your conversation and I'm here to help resolve your billing question. I can see you're asking about the difference between your expected charge and actual charge - let me look into that for you right away."
```

**Conversation Override:**
```
AI Response Management:

Override Scenarios:
• AI provides incorrect information
• Response lacks empathy or appropriate tone
• Complex situation requires human touch
• Customer needs more detailed explanation
• Policy exception or special case handling

Override Process:
1. Prevent AI response from sending (if caught in time)
2. Craft appropriate human response
3. Send corrected response to customer
4. Flag incident for AI training improvement
5. Document override reason for analysis

Override Best Practices:
• Maintain conversation flow and context
• Address customer concern directly
• Provide more helpful or accurate information
• Use empathetic and personalized language
• Follow up to ensure customer satisfaction
```

### Escalation Management
**Seamless Human Handoff Process:**

**Automatic Escalation Triggers:**
```
When AI Automatically Escalates:

Confidence Thresholds:
• AI confidence below 70% for 3 consecutive responses
• Customer asks same question 3+ times without satisfaction
• AI detects frustration keywords ("angry," "terrible," "awful")
• Complex technical issues beyond AI knowledge
• Billing disputes or refund requests

Escalation Process:
1. AI recognizes escalation trigger
2. Notifies human agent immediately  
3. Provides conversation context and summary
4. Introduces human agent to customer
5. Transfers full conversation control
6. Maintains conversation history

Example AI Escalation Message:
"I want to make sure you get the best possible help with this issue. Let me connect you with one of our human support specialists who can provide more detailed assistance. Please hold on for just a moment while I transfer you."
```

**Manual Escalation Options:**
```
Customer-Initiated Escalation:

Common Escalation Requests:
• "Can I speak to a human?"
• "I need to talk to someone"
• "This isn't helping"
• "Get me a real person"
• "Transfer me to support"

Agent Response Protocol:
1. Acknowledge escalation request immediately
2. Apologize if AI couldn't resolve issue
3. Provide realistic wait time estimate
4. Gather additional context if needed
5. Connect to available human agent
6. Transfer conversation with full context

Escalation Response Template:
"Of course! I'll connect you with one of our human support specialists right away. They'll have access to our full conversation, so you won't need to repeat your question. Typical wait time is under 2 minutes. Thank you for your patience!"
```
