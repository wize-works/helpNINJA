└── Backup: David K. (if Lisa unavailable)
```

**Dynamic Prioritization:**
```
⚡ Real-Time Priority Assignment

Priority Levels:
├── 🔴 Critical (SLA: 1 minute response):
│   ├── Enterprise customers with service-affecting issues
│   ├── Security or data breach concerns

│
└── ℹ️  Low (SLA: 10 minutes response):
    ├── Documentation questions
    ├── Training requests
    ├── Non-urgent feature discussions
    └── General product inquiries

Dynamic Priority Adjustment:
├── Customer Wait Time: +1 priority level after 5 minutes
├── Multiple Escalations: +1 priority level for repeat issues
├── Customer Sentiment: +1 priority level for frustrated customers
├── Business Hours: Standard priorities during business hours
├── After Hours: All escalations elevated by 1 priority level
