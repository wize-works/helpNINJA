✅ **Modify tone appropriately** for different situations and customers
✅ **Vary response structure** to match customer communication patterns

❌ **Don't over-personalize** - Maintain professional boundaries
❌ **Don't sacrifice clarity** - Personalization should improve, not confuse

### Maintain Consistency
**Coherent experience across interactions:**

**Within Conversations:**

- **Evolve appropriately** as customer relationships develop

### Respect Customer Preferences
**Let customers guide the interaction style:**

**Direct Feedback:**

- **Communication feedback** - "That was too technical" or "Can you explain more?"
- **Tone adjustments** - "More formal please" or "You can be casual with me"
- **Format preferences** - "Step-by-step lists work best" or "I like examples"

**Indirect Signals:**

### Inconsistent Personalization
