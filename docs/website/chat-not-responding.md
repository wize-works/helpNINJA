# Chat Not Responding - Troubleshooting

## Quick Response Check

When your helpNINJA chat widget appears but doesn't respond to customer messages, follow these steps to identify and resolve the issue quickly.

### Immediate Diagnosis Steps

**Step 1: Verify Basic Functionality**
1. **Open your chat widget** on your website
2. **Send a simple test message** like "Hello" or "Test"
3. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for response
4. **Check for any error messages** or loading indicators

**Step 2: Check Service Status**
1. **Look for service status indicators** in your helpNINJA dashboard
2. **Check for maintenance notifications** or service alerts
3. **Verify your account status** - ensure subscription is active
4. **Review usage limits** - check if monthly message limits reached

**Step 3: Browser Console Check**
1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for error messages** when sending chat messages
4. **Note any red error messages** for troubleshooting

## Common Response Issues

### No Response at All

**Issue: Messages send but no reply appears**

**Cause 1: Service Connectivity Problems**
- **Network issues** between widget and helpNINJA servers
- **Server maintenance** or temporary service disruption
- **Account authentication problems**

**Solution:**
1. **Check internet connection** - Try loading other websites
2. **Test from different network** - Mobile hotspot, different WiFi
3. **Clear browser cache** and refresh page
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** and try again (might be temporary service issue)

**Cause 2: Configuration Problems**
- **Incorrect tenant ID** in widget installation
- **API endpoint issues** in custom integrations
- **Knowledge base not properly configured**

**Solution:**
1. **Verify tenant ID** - Compare widget code with dashboard settings
2. **Check dashboard configuration** - Ensure AI assistant is properly set up
3. **Review knowledge base** - Verify content is available and published
4. **Test with default settings** - Remove custom configurations temporarily

**Cause 3: Account Issues**
- **Subscription expired** or payment problems
- **Usage limits exceeded** for current billing period
- **Account suspension** due to policy violations

**Solution:**
1. **Check billing status** in dashboard account settings
2. **Review usage statistics** - verify within plan limits
3. **Update payment information** if needed
4. **Contact billing support** for account-specific issues

### Delayed Responses

**Issue: Chat responds but takes too long (over 30 seconds)**

**Cause 1: High Server Load**
- **Peak usage periods** causing response delays
- **Complex queries** requiring more processing time
- **Large knowledge base** taking time to search

**Solution:**
1. **Try simpler questions** first - test with basic queries
2. **Avoid peak hours** if possible for testing
3. **Monitor performance** during different times of day
4. **Consider plan upgrade** if delays are consistent

**Cause 2: Integration Bottlenecks**
- **Slow webhook responses** from connected systems
- **Database query performance** issues
- **Third-party API delays** in custom integrations

**Solution:**
1. **Test without integrations** - Disable webhooks temporarily
2. **Check third-party service status** for connected tools
3. **Review integration logs** for performance issues
4. **Optimize database queries** if using custom integrations

### Partial or Broken Responses

**Issue: Chat responds with error messages or incomplete answers**

**Cause 1: Knowledge Base Issues**
- **Incomplete knowledge base** content
- **Corrupted or malformed** training data
- **Recent updates** not properly processed

**Solution:**
1. **Review knowledge base content** - Check for completeness and accuracy
2. **Re-upload problematic content** if specific topics fail
3. **Wait for processing** - Recent updates might still be indexing
4. **Test with questions** you know should have good answers

**Cause 2: AI Processing Problems**
- **Complex or ambiguous** customer questions
- **Language or terminology** not well covered in training
- **Edge cases** not handled by current AI model

**Solution:**
1. **Try rephrasing questions** in simpler terms
2. **Add more training content** for problematic topics
3. **Review successful conversation examples** to understand patterns
4. **Consider escalation rules** for complex questions

## Response Quality Issues

### Irrelevant or Wrong Responses

**Issue: Chat responds but answers are unhelpful or incorrect**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Knowledge base gaps** - Missing information for customer questions
2. **Poor content quality** - Outdated or incorrect information in knowledge base
3. **AI training issues** - Insufficient examples for certain types of questions
4. **Context misunderstanding** - AI misinterpreting customer intent

**Immediate Solutions:**
1. **Review and update** knowledge base content for accuracy
2. **Add specific examples** of correct answers for common questions
3. **Remove or correct** outdated information that might confuse AI
4. **Test improvements** with known problematic questions

**Long-term Improvements:**
1. **Regular content audits** - Monthly review of knowledge base accuracy
2. **Customer feedback integration** - Use ratings to identify response quality issues
3. **Conversation analysis** - Review chat logs for common misunderstandings
4. **Escalation rule optimization** - Route complex questions to humans appropriately

### Repetitive or Generic Responses

**Issue: Chat gives same response repeatedly or overly generic answers**

**Cause 1: Limited Training Data**
- **Insufficient content variety** in knowledge base
- **Repetitive training examples** leading to similar responses
- **Narrow content coverage** for specific topics

**Solution:**
1. **Expand knowledge base** with more diverse content
2. **Add alternative phrasings** for same information
3. **Include conversational examples** showing different response styles
4. **Review content diversity** across different topics

**Cause 2: AI Configuration Issues**
- **Response settings too conservative** - AI defaulting to safe, generic answers
- **Confidence thresholds** set incorrectly
- **Personalization features** not properly configured

**Solution:**
1. **Adjust AI settings** - Review response style and confidence settings
2. **Enable personalization** features if available in your plan
3. **Test different configuration** options to find optimal balance
4. **Monitor response variety** after making changes

## Technical Troubleshooting

### Network and Connectivity Issues

**Diagnosing Connection Problems:**

**Client-Side Issues:**
1. **Slow internet connection** - Affects message sending and receiving
