## Understanding Usage Metrics

### Messages vs. Conversations

**Messages**: Individual customer questions sent to your AI
- Each time a customer types and sends a message, it counts toward your limit
- This is what determines your plan usage and billing
- Assistant responses don't count against your limit

**Conversations**: Complete chat sessions between customer and AI
- One conversation can include many messages back and forth
- Used for analytics and understanding customer engagement
- Don't directly impact your billing

### What Counts Toward Your Limit

‚úÖ **Counts as a message**:
- Customer questions sent to your AI
- Follow-up questions in the same conversation
- Messages from different customers or sessions

‚ùå **Doesn't count**:
- AI responses back to customers
- Internal testing messages (admin testing)
- Failed messages due to technical issues
- Messages during system maintenance

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Dashboard Monitoring

Your main dashboard shows:
- **Messages This Month**: Current usage toward your limit
- **Usage Percentage**: How much of your plan you've used
- **Days Remaining**: How many days left in your billing cycle

### Usage Analytics

In your Analytics section, you'll find:
- **Daily/Weekly Trends**: See usage patterns over time

## What Happens When You Hit Your Limit?

### Soft Limit Approach

helpNINJA uses a "soft limit" system designed to never leave your customers hanging:

2. **Grace period**: Small overages are handled gracefully  
3. **Upgrade prompts**: Dashboard will suggest plan upgrades
4. **Continued service**: Your AI keeps working while you decide

### Overage Billing

If you consistently exceed your plan:

- **Large overages (over 25%)**: Automatic upgrade recommendation

### Preventing Service Interruption

1. **Monitor usage regularly**: Check dashboard weekly
