2. Send correction message immediately
3. Apologize for confusion and provide accurate information
4. Offer additional assistance to ensure customer satisfaction
5. Flag the knowledge base content for immediate update
6. Document the error for training improvement

Example Correction Response:
"I need to correct my previous response - I provided outdated information about our billing policy. The correct information is: [accurate details]. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Is there anything else I can clarify about your billing question?"

Escalation Recovery:
• When escalating due to AI limitations, explain transition smoothly
• Provide context to human agent about what was attempted
• Ensure customer doesn't need to repeat information
• Follow up to confirm issue resolution
• Use experience to improve future AI responses
