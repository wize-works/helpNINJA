# Setting Up Escalation Rules

## What Are Escalation Rules?

Escalation rules automatically determine when and how customer conversations get transferred from your AI assistant to your human support team. Well-configured rules ensure customers get the right level of help at the right time.

## Why Escalation Rules Matter

### Customer Experience Benefits
- **No customers left hanging** - Clear path to human help when needed
- **Appropriate response level** - Complex issues get expert attention
- **Faster resolution** - Right questions go to right people immediately
- **Consistent service** - Predictable escalation for similar situations

### Team Efficiency Benefits
- **Reduced noise** - Only escalations that truly need human attention
- **Better prioritization** - Important issues surface automatically
- **Context preservation** - Team sees full conversation before responding
- **Workload management** - Controlled flow of escalated conversations

## Types of Escalation Triggers

### Confidence-Based Escalation
**When AI isn't confident in its responses:**
- **Low confidence threshold** - AI confidence score below set percentage (e.g., 50%)
- **Consecutive low confidence** - Multiple poor responses in same conversation
- **No relevant content found** - AI can't find information to answer question
- **Ambiguous questions** - Customer question unclear or too broad

### Customer-Requested Escalation
**When customers explicitly ask for human help:**
- **Direct requests** - "Can I talk to a person?" or "I need human help"
- **Frustration indicators** - "This isn't helping" or "I'm confused"
- **Escalation keywords** - Specific phrases you configure as triggers
- **Repeat questions** - Customer asks same thing multiple ways

### Topic-Based Escalation
**Specific subjects that always need human attention:**
- **Billing and payment issues** - Refunds, charges, account problems
- **Technical support** - Complex troubleshooting requiring expertise
- **Sales inquiries** - Questions requiring personalized consultation
- **Complaints** - Customer dissatisfaction needing personal attention

### Urgency-Based Escalation
**Time-sensitive or critical situations:**
- **Emergency keywords** - "urgent," "emergency," "broken," "down"
- **Security concerns** - Account access, suspicious activity
- **Business-critical issues** - Problems affecting customer operations
- **Complaint escalation** - Dissatisfied customers needing immediate attention

## Setting Up Your Escalation Rules

### Step 1: Define Your Escalation Strategy
**Before configuring rules, decide:**
- **What should escalate?** - Which situations need human intervention
- **Who handles escalations?** - Team members or departments responsible
- **How fast should escalations happen?** - Immediate vs batched notifications
- **What information should be included?** - Context and details for your team

### Step 2: Configure Escalation Triggers
**In your helpNINJA dashboard:**

1. **Go to Settings → Escalation Rules**
2. **Create New Rule** or modify existing ones
3. **Set trigger conditions:**
   - Confidence threshold (recommended: 50% or lower)
   - Specific keywords or phrases
   - Topic categories requiring human help
   - Customer request indicators

### Step 3: Set Up Notification Methods
**Choose how your team gets notified:**
- **Email notifications** - Sent to specific addresses
- **Slack integration** - Messages in designated channels
- **Webhook notifications** - For custom integrations
- **Dashboard alerts** - In-app notifications for team members

### Step 4: Configure Escalation Content
**What information gets sent to your team:**
- **Full conversation history** - Everything customer and AI discussed
- **Customer's original question** - What they initially needed help with
- **AI's attempted response** - What the assistant tried to provide
- **Confidence scores** - How confident AI was in each response
- **Escalation reason** - Why this conversation was escalated

## Recommended Escalation Rule Configurations

### Basic Setup (Getting Started)
**Essential rules for any business:**
```
1. Low Confidence Escalation
   - Trigger: AI confidence below 50%
   - Action: Email notification to support team
   - Include: Full conversation + confidence scores

2. Customer Request Escalation  
   - Trigger: Keywords like "human," "person," "agent"
   - Action: Immediate notification
   - Include: Customer's exact request

3. Repeat Question Escalation
   - Trigger: Customer asks same question 3+ times
   - Action: Escalate with high priority
   - Include: All attempted responses
```

### Advanced Configuration
**For businesses with specialized needs:**
```
1. Topic-Specific Escalation
   - Trigger: Questions about billing, refunds, technical issues
   - Action: Route to appropriate department
   - Include: Conversation + customer account info

2. Business Hours Escalation
   - Trigger: Any escalation during business hours
   - Action: Immediate Slack notification
   - After hours: Email with morning follow-up reminder

3. VIP Customer Escalation
   - Trigger: Escalations from premium customers
   - Action: Priority notification to senior support
   - Include: Customer tier information
```

### E-commerce Specific Rules
**Common for online retailers:**

   - Trigger: Questions about "order," "shipping," "delivery"
   - Action: Route to fulfillment team
   - Include: Order lookup capability

2. Product Support Escalation
   - Trigger: "Broken," "defective," "return," "exchange"
   - Action: Product support team notification
   - Include: Product identification info
```

## Escalation Rule Best Practices

### Start Conservative, Refine Over Time
**Initial approach:**
- **Set broad escalation triggers** to catch issues early
- **Monitor escalation volume** for first few weeks
- **Refine rules** based on actual patterns you see
- **Gradually optimize** to reduce noise while maintaining coverage

### Balance AI Efficiency with Human Backup
**Finding the right balance:**
- **Don't over-escalate** - Let AI handle what it does well
- **Don't under-escalate** - Ensure customers get help when needed
- **Monitor customer satisfaction** - Are customers getting appropriate help?
- **Track team workload** - Are escalations manageable?

### Provide Context for Your Team
**Make escalations actionable:**
- **Include full conversation** - Team understands what's already been discussed
- **Explain escalation reason** - Why this needed human attention
- **Provide customer background** - Account status, previous interactions
- **Suggest next steps** - What the team member should do first

## Managing Escalation Volume

### If You're Getting Too Many Escalations
**Common causes and solutions:**
- **AI confidence too high** → Lower confidence threshold gradually
- **Missing content** → Add knowledge base articles for common escalations
- **Unclear content** → Improve existing articles that generate confusion
- **Over-broad triggers** → Make escalation keywords more specific

### If You're Getting Too Few Escalations
**Ensuring customers get help when needed:**
- **AI confidence too low** → Raise confidence threshold slightly
- **Missing trigger phrases** → Add more customer request variations
- **Narrow topic rules** → Expand categories that should escalate
- **Customer feedback** → Ask if they're getting adequate help

### Optimizing Escalation Quality
**Improving escalation usefulness:**
- **Better trigger specificity** → More precise rules for relevant escalations
- **Enhanced context** → More useful information for responding team
- **Faster notifications** → Reduced response time for escalated customers
- **Clearer prioritization** → Different urgency levels for different escalation types

## Monitoring Escalation Performance

### Key Metrics to Track
**Escalation effectiveness:**
- **Escalation rate** - Percentage of conversations that escalate
- **Resolution rate** - How many escalations get successfully resolved
- **Response time** - How quickly team responds to escalations
- **Customer satisfaction** - Feedback on escalated conversation outcomes

### Weekly Escalation Review
**Questions to ask:**
- **Are escalations appropriate?** - Do they actually need human attention?
- **Are customers satisfied?** - Getting better help after escalation?
- **Is team capacity adequate?** - Can team handle current escalation volume?
- **Are patterns emerging?** - Common escalation types suggesting content gaps?

### Monthly Optimization
**Systematic improvement:**
- **Rule effectiveness analysis** - Which rules work well vs poorly?
- **Content gap identification** - What knowledge base updates would reduce escalations?
- **Team training needs** - Are team members handling escalations well?
- **Process improvements** - How can escalation workflow be enhanced?
