## Creating Effective Templates

### Template Creation Process

**Step 1: Analyze Common Questions**
1. **Review Chat History**: Identify frequently asked questions
2. **Check Escalation Patterns**: Note what conversations need human help
3. **Analyze Search Data**: See what customers search for most
4. **Survey Team Members**: Ask what questions they answer repeatedly

**Step 2: Draft Template Content**
1. **Start with Best Responses**: Use your team's best actual responses
2. **Add Personalization**: Include relevant dynamic variables
3. **Structure Information**: Use headers, bullets, and emojis for readability
4. **Include Next Steps**: Guide customers to resolution or further help

**Step 3: Test and Refine**
1. **A/B Testing**: Try different versions of templates
2. **Customer Feedback**: Monitor satisfaction scores for template responses
3. **Team Input**: Get feedback from team members using templates
4. **Performance Analysis**: Track which templates work best

### Writing Best Practices

**Tone and Voice:**
```
❌ Poor Template:
"Your account is locked. Reset your password to unlock it."

✅ Better Template:  
"I can help you unlock your account! 🔓 

It looks like your account was automatically locked for security after several login attempts. This is normal and helps protect your data.

Here's how to get back in:
1. Click 'Forgot Password' on the login page
2. Check your email for the reset link
3. Create a new password

You'll be back up and running in just a minute! Let me know if you need any help with the process. 😊"
```

**Information Structure:**
```
Effective Template Structure:
1. Empathetic acknowledgment
2. Clear explanation of the situation  
3. Step-by-step solution
4. Alternative options if needed
5. Offer for additional help
6. Positive, encouraging close
```

**Personalization Strategies:**
```
Generic: "Here's how to update your account"
Personalized: "Hi {{CUSTOMER_NAME}}! I'll help you update your {{PLAN_NAME}} account settings"

Generic: "Contact our support team"  
Personalized: "Let me connect you with {{TEAM_MEMBER}} who specializes in {{CATEGORY}} issues"

Generic: "We're here to help"
Personalized: "I'm here to help you get the most out of {{SITE_NAME}}!"
```
