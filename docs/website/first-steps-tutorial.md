## Part 3: Set Up Smart Escalations (10 minutes)

Even the best AI needs backup. Let's configure when and how to escalate to humans.

### Step 3.1: Configure Confidence Thresholds

1. **Go to Settings â†’ Escalations**
2. **Set Confidence Threshold**: 
   - **High Confidence (0.8+)**: AI answers directly
   - **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)**: AI answers with "Let me know if you need more help"
   - **Low Confidence (0.5-)**: Automatic escalation to human

3. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Ask a clear question: "What are your hours?" (should be high confidence)
   - Ask a vague question: "I have a problem" (should trigger escalation)
   - Ask about something not in your content (should escalate)

### Step 3.2: Set Up Escalation Channels

**Option A: Email Escalations (Easiest)**
1. **Go to Integrations â†’ Email**
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - **To Email**: your-support@company.com
   - **From Name**: "helpNINJA Support"
   - **Subject Template**: "New Support Request from {customerName}"

**Option B: Slack Integration (Recommended)**
1. **Go to Integrations â†’ Slack**
2. **Connect Your Workspace**: Follow OAuth flow
3. **Choose Channel**: #customer-support or similar
4. **Configure Message Format**:
   ```
   ðŸš¨ New escalation from website chat:
   Customer: {customerName}
   Question: {originalMessage}
   Chat Context: {conversationHistory}
   ```

### Step 3.3: Test Escalations

1. **Trigger an Escalation**:
   - Go to your website chat
   - Ask something like "I need to speak to a human" or "This isn't working"
   - Should trigger immediate escalation

2. **Verify Receipt**:
   - Check your email/Slack for the escalation
   - Confirm all context is included
   - Make sure response instructions are clear

## Part 4: Monitor and Improve (10 minutes)

Now let's set up monitoring so you can continuously improve your support system.

### Step 4.1: Explore Analytics Dashboard

1. **Go to Analytics â†’ Overview**
2. **Key Metrics to Watch**:
   - **Total Conversations**: How many people are using chat
   - **Average Response Time**: How quickly AI responds
   - **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of conversations that need human help
   - **Customer Satisfaction**: Ratings from chat users

3. **Dive Deeper**:
   - **Popular Questions**: What do people ask most?
   - **Failed Queries**: Questions the AI couldn't answer
   - **Peak Usage Times**: When is chat most active?

### Step 4.2: Identify Improvement Opportunities

**Look for Patterns:**
1. **High Escalation Topics**: 
   - If many questions about "pricing" escalate, add more pricing details
   - If "technical support" always escalates, create troubleshooting guides

2. **Common Question Types**:
   - Track the most frequent questions
   - Create detailed content for popular topics
   - Update your FAQ based on real usage

3. **Customer Feedback**:
   - Monitor satisfaction ratings
   - Read customer comments
   - Identify pain points in the conversation flow

### Step 4.3: Make Your First Improvement

Based on your analytics, let's make an improvement:

1. **Find Your Top Escalated Question**:
   - Look at escalation logs
   - Identify the most common question that needs human help

2. **Create Content to Address It**:
   - Write a comprehensive answer
   - Add it to your knowledge base
   - Include examples and step-by-step instructions

3. **Test the Improvement**:
   - Ask the same question in chat
   - Verify the AI now provides a good answer
   - Check that escalation rate decreases for this topic
