## Conversation Intervention Strategies

### When to Intervene
**Identifying Intervention Opportunities:**

**Automatic Intervention Triggers:**
```
System-Generated Alerts:

Confidence-Based Triggers:
• AI confidence drops below 70% for 2+ consecutive responses
• Confidence decline trend over 20 points in single conversation
• AI responds with "I don't know" or uncertainty phrases

Customer Behavior Triggers:
• Customer expresses frustration ("this isn't working", "terrible")
• Customer requests human agent ("speak to someone", "real person")
• Customer uses urgent language ("emergency", "critical", "immediately")
• Customer indicates they may leave/cancel service

Technical Triggers:
• Conversation exceeds average length by 200%
• Complex technical issue detected in conversation
• Billing dispute or refund request identified
• Account security issue flagged

Quality Triggers:
• Customer satisfaction rating below 3 stars during conversation
• Multiple negative responses to "Was this helpful?" prompts
• Agent override of AI response needed
• Escalation requested by AI system
```

**Manual Intervention Indicators:**
```
Human Judgment Calls:

Conversation Quality Issues:
• AI responses don't fully address customer question
• Customer seems confused or frustrated with AI responses
• Answer accuracy questionable based on knowledge base
• Response tone inappropriate for customer emotional state

Business Impact Situations:
• High-value customer needs special attention
• Potential escalation to cancel service
• Complex billing or account issue
• Legal or compliance matter raised

Opportunity Recognition:
• Upselling or cross-selling opportunity identified
• Customer feedback or feature request shared
• Partnership or integration inquiry
• Media or influencer interaction
```

### Intervention Techniques
**Effective Ways to Join Conversations:**

**Seamless Agent Introduction:**
```
Best Practices for Joining Conversations:

Smooth Transition Approach:
1. Review conversation history thoroughly
2. Understand customer issue and AI attempts
3. Identify specific help needed
4. Join with context-aware introduction
5. Acknowledge AI assistance and build on it

Example Smooth Introduction:
"Hi Maria, I'm Sarah from helpNINJA support. I've been following your conversation about the WordPress widget installation issue. I can see you're getting a 'widget.js failed to load' error - that's actually a common issue with certain security plugin configurations. Let me walk you through a specific solution that should resolve this for you."

Avoid Abrupt Transitions:
❌ "Hello, I'm taking over this conversation."
❌ "The AI couldn't help you, so I'm here now."
❌ "Let me start over from the beginning."

✅ "I'm here to build on what we've discussed so far."
✅ "Let me provide some additional insight on this issue."
✅ "I can offer more specific guidance for your situation."
```

**Conversation Takeover Process:**
```
Agent Intervention Workflow:

Pre-Intervention (30 seconds):
• Read complete conversation history
• Check customer account and previous interactions
• Identify specific issue and attempted solutions
• Prepare helpful resources and next steps
• Ensure understanding of customer emotional state

During Introduction (First 60 seconds):
• Introduce yourself with name and role
• Acknowledge customer's issue and previous conversation
• Express empathy if customer is frustrated
• Provide confidence that you can help resolve issue
• Ask clarifying questions if needed

Post-Introduction (Ongoing):
• Focus on resolving customer issue quickly
• Provide clear, step-by-step guidance
• Verify understanding and success at each step
• Maintain professional, helpful tone throughout
• Document solution for future AI learning
