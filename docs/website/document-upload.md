## Preparing Documents for Upload

### Document Optimization
**Making Your Documents Upload-Ready:**

```
Well-Structured Document Elements:

```

**Content Quality Guidelines:**
- **One topic per document** - Keep focused on single subjects
- **Clear, descriptive titles** - Help AI understand document purpose
- **Current information only** - Remove outdated or obsolete content
- **Customer-focused language** - Write for your customers, not internal teams
- **Complete information** - Include all necessary details and context
