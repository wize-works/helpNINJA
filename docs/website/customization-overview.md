## Customization Best Practices

### Design and User Experience Guidelines
**Creating Effective Chat Experiences:**

**Visual Design Best Practices:**
```
Professional Design Principles:

Brand Consistency:
• Maintain consistent colors with your existing brand palette
• Use typography that complements your website's font choices
• Ensure visual elements align with your overall design language
• Create seamless integration that feels native to your site
• Test design consistency across different pages and contexts

Accessibility and Usability:
• Maintain sufficient color contrast for text readability (WCAG AA)
• Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile use
• Provide clear visual feedback for interactive elements
• Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels for screen readers
• Test with users who have different accessibility needs

Performance Considerations:
• Optimize custom fonts and images for fast loading
• Minimize CSS size and complexity for better performance
• Use efficient animations that don't impact device performance
• Test customizations across different devices and connection speeds
• Monitor performance metrics after implementing customizations
