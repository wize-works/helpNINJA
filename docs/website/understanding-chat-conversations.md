# Understanding Chat Conversations

## What Are Chat Conversations in helpNINJA?

Every time a customer interacts with your chat widget, helpNINJA creates a conversation record. Understanding how these conversations work helps you make the most of your customer interactions.

## Anatomy of a Conversation

### How Conversations Start
A conversation begins when a customer:
- **Types their first message** in your chat widget
- **Asks a question** or requests help
- **Interacts with the chat interface** on your website

### Conversation Components
Each conversation contains:
- **Session ID** - Unique identifier for this customer's visit
- **Conversation ID** - Unique identifier for this specific chat
- **Messages** - All back-and-forth between customer and AI
- **Timestamps** - When each message was sent
- **Confidence scores** - How confident the AI was in each response
- **Escalation triggers** - If/when human help was needed

### How Conversations End
Conversations typically end when:
- **Customer gets their answer** and leaves the chat
- **Customer closes the chat window**
- **Session times out** after period of inactivity
- **Customer escalates** to human support (conversation continues there)

## Types of Conversations You'll See

### Quick Q&A (Most Common)
- **Customer asks one question**
- **AI provides answer**
- **Customer leaves satisfied**
- **Usually high confidence scores**

**Example:**
- Customer: "What are your business hours?"
- AI: "We're open Monday-Friday 9am-6pm EST..."
- *Conversation ends*

### Multi-turn Conversations
- **Customer asks follow-up questions**
- **AI builds on previous responses**
- **May require clarification or additional detail**

**Example:**
- Customer: "How do I reset my password?"
- AI: "You can reset your password by..."
- Customer: "What if I don't receive the email?"
- AI: "If you don't receive the reset email, try..."

### Escalated Conversations
- **AI provides initial help**
- **Customer needs more assistance**
- **Gets transferred to human support**
- **Continues with your team**

**Example:**
- Customer: "My order is missing items"
- AI: "I can help with order issues. Let me find information..."
- AI: "I see you need specific order assistance. Connecting you with our team..."
- *Escalates to human support*

### Complex Problem-Solving
- **Customer has complicated situation**
- **AI provides partial help**
- **May require multiple attempts**
- **Often ends in escalation**

**Example:**
- Customer: "I'm having trouble with integration setup and getting errors"
- AI: "I can help with integration issues. What error are you seeing?"
- Customer: "It says connection failed but I followed all the steps"
- AI: "Let me connect you with our technical team for personalized help"
