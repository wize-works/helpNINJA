helpNINJA: "I understand you need to return an item from last week because of a color issue, and you're concerned about not having the receipt. Here's good news: we can process your return in several ways:

1. **Email Receipt**: Check your email for the order confirmation - this works as a receipt
2. **Account History**: If you have an account, we can find the order in your purchase history  
3. **Card Statement**: We can look up orders using the last 4 digits of your payment card
