# Multi-Language Support

## Current Language Capabilities

helpNINJA offers **basic multi-language support** through AI-powered responses. Here's what you can expect when serving international customers.

## What Works Today

### AI Language Understanding
Your helpNINJA assistant can understand and respond to customer questions in many languages, including:
- Spanish
- French  
- German
- Portuguese
- Italian
- Japanese
- Chinese
- And many others

### How It Works
When customers write to your chat widget in their preferred language:
1. **They ask their question** in Spanish, French, German, etc.
2. **helpNINJA understands** their question using AI
3. **Searches your knowledge base** (even if it's in English)
4. **Responds in their language** with relevant information

## Current Limitations

### Widget Interface
- Chat widget buttons and labels are in English only
- System messages like "Connecting..." appear in English
- No language selection dropdown available

### Your Content
- Works best when your uploaded content is in the same language as customer questions
- Mixed-language results if your knowledge base is in English but customers ask in other languages
- No automatic translation of your existing content

### Dashboard & Reports
- Your dashboard and analytics are in English
- Conversation logs show in whatever language customers used
- No language-specific reporting available

## Best Practices for International Customers

### Single Language Approach (Recommended)
If most of your customers speak one non-English language:
- **Upload your knowledge base** in that language
- **Test the chat** with typical customer questions
- **Monitor response quality** to ensure accuracy

### Mixed Language Situations
If you serve customers in multiple languages:
- **Start with your primary customer language** for uploaded content
- **Test thoroughly** with questions in different languages
- **Have backup support** available for complex multilingual issues
- **Set clear expectations** with customers about language capabilities

## Testing Your Setup

### Before Going Live
1. **Ask test questions** in your customers' languages
2. **Check response quality** - are answers helpful and accurate?
3. **Verify key information** is communicated correctly
4. **Test with different types of questions** (simple FAQs vs complex issues)

### Monitoring Performance
- **Review conversations** in different languages regularly
- **Look for patterns** where responses seem unhelpful
- **Ask for customer feedback** about response quality
- **Adjust your content** based on what you learn

## When Multi-Language Support Works Well

✅ **Good fit if:**
- Your customers primarily speak 1-2 languages
- You can provide content in those languages  
- Questions are typically straightforward
- You have backup support for complex issues

⚠️ **May need alternatives if:**
- You need official translations for legal/medical content
- Customers require precise technical terminology
- You serve many different languages equally
- Accuracy is absolutely critical for your business
