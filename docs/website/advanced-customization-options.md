Real-World Plugin Implementation:

Advanced CRM Integration Plugin:
Purpose: Deep Salesforce integration with custom object support
Features:
• Real-time bidirectional data synchronization
• Custom Salesforce object integration (beyond standard contacts/leads)
• Advanced workflow triggers based on Salesforce events
• Custom field mapping and transformation rules
• Sophisticated lead scoring and qualification automation

Code Structure:
```typescript
// CRM Integration Plugin Example
import { PluginAPI, ConversationEvent, CustomerData } from '@helpninja/sdk';

export class AdvancedCRMPlugin {
  private api: PluginAPI;
  private salesforceClient: SalesforceClient;

  constructor(api: PluginAPI) {
    this.api = api;
    this.salesforceClient = new SalesforceClient(api.config);
  }

  async onConversationStart(event: ConversationEvent) {
    // Custom logic for conversation initiation
    const customerData = await this.enrichCustomerData(event.customer);
    await this.api.updateConversationContext(event.id, customerData);
  }

  async enrichCustomerData(customer: CustomerData) {
    // Advanced customer enrichment logic
    const salesforceData = await this.salesforceClient.getCustomerData(customer.email);
    return this.mergeCustomerData(customer, salesforceData);
  }
}
```

Custom Analytics Dashboard Plugin:
```typescript
// Advanced Analytics Plugin Example
import { AnalyticsPlugin, MetricData, DashboardComponent } from '@helpninja/sdk';

export class CustomAnalyticsPlugin extends AnalyticsPlugin {
  async generateCustomMetrics(): Promise<MetricData[]> {
    // Custom business intelligence calculations
    const conversionFunnel = await this.calculateConversionFunnel();
    const customerLifetimeValue = await this.calculateCLV();
    const predictiveAnalytics = await this.generatePredictions();
    
    return [conversionFunnel, customerLifetimeValue, predictiveAnalytics];
  }

  renderDashboard(): DashboardComponent {
    return (
      <CustomDashboard 
        metrics={this.metrics}
        onMetricClick={this.handleMetricInteraction}
        theme={this.api.theme}
      />
