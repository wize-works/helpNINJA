# Escalation Choice Modal Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a user choice modal for manual escalations that prevents the "spam all integrations" issue. This replaces the previous behavior where clicking "Manual Escalation" would send to ALL configured integrations simultaneously.

## What We Implemented

### 1. EscalationChoiceModal Component (`src/components/escalation-choice-modal.tsx`)

A comprehensive modal that allows users to:

- **Select specific integrations** to escalate to (with visual previews)
- **Choose escalation reason** from predefined options:
  - Manual Review Requested
  - Complex Issue  
  - Customer Requested Human
  - Urgent Issue
  - Billing Related
  - Technical Support
  - Other
- **Add custom context** for the support team
- **Review conversation context** (shows latest user message)
- **Bulk operations** (Select All/Deselect All)
- **Visual integration status** with provider icons and colors

### 2. Updated ManualEscalationButton (`src/components/manual-escalation-button.tsx`)

Now opens the modal instead of directly escalating, providing:
- Better user experience with intentional choices
- Prevention of accidental escalations to wrong channels
- Clear feedback on what will happen

### 3. Enhanced Escalation API (`src/app/api/escalate/route.ts`)

Added support for:
- `selectedIntegrations` array parameter
- Conversion to proper destination format
- Metadata tracking of selected integrations
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Key Features

### Smart Integration Selection
- Loads all active integrations for the tenant
- Pre-selects all integrations by default (maintains current behavior as default)
- Visual icons for each provider (Slack, Teams, Discord, Linear, etc.)
- Color-coded integration types
- Real-time selection counter

### Escalation Context
- Shows conversation session ID
- Displays latest user message (truncated if needed)
- Allows additional context to be added
- Reason categorization for better tracking

### Error Handling
- Graceful loading states
- Clear error messages
- Handles no-integrations scenario with setup guidance
- Prevents escalation with zero selections

### UX Improvements  
- Modal can be dismissed without action
- Loading states during API calls
- Success confirmation
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet

## Implementation Details

### Integration Selection Logic
```typescript
// Users can select specific integrations
selectedIntegrations: ['integration-1', 'integration-2']

// API converts these to destination format
matchedRuleDestinations = selectedIntegrations.map(id => ({
    type: 'integration',
    integration_id: id
}))
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Old escalation calls without `selectedIntegrations` work unchanged
- Maintains existing behavior for automatic escalations (low confidence)
- Only manual escalations get the new modal experience

### Future Enhancements Ready
The implementation is designed to easily support:
- Tenant-level escalation preferences
- Integration-specific message templates  
- Time-based routing rules
- Priority-based escalation workflows
- Integration health status in selection

## Testing the Feature

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any conversation details page: `/dashboard/conversations/[id]`
3. Click "Manual Escalation" button in the sidebar
4. Modal will appear showing integration choices
5. Select desired integrations and escalation reason
6. Submit to escalate only to selected channels

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Prevents Integration Spam**: No more simultaneous tickets in Linear + Zendesk + ServiceNow  
✅ **User Control**: Agents choose exactly where to escalate  
✅ **Context Preservation**: Additional context and reason tracking  
✅ **Better UX**: Clear, intentional escalation process  
✅ **Audit Trail**: Tracks which integrations were selected  
✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Handles edge cases like no active integrations  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing auto-escalations unchanged  

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

1. **Tenant Preferences**: Set default escalation preferences per tenant
2. **Smart Routing**: Auto-select integrations based on issue type/time
3. **Integration Templates**: Custom message templates per integration
4. **Escalation Workflows**: Multi-step escalation processes
5. **Analytics**: Track escalation patterns and integration effectiveness

This implementation immediately solves the core problem while providing a foundation for future escalation management enhancements.
