# Widget Integration Options Update

## Overview

To improve the user experience for installing the helpNINJA widget across different frameworks and environments, we've enhanced the widget installation code section in the site wizard modal.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Multi-Framework Integration Options

We've created a new component `IntegrationOptions` that provides code snippets for integrating the helpNINJA widget in various environments:

- Plain HTML
- Next.js
- React
- Vue.js
- Angular
- WordPress
- Direct Link (URL parameters)

### 2. Improved Documentation

We've added a comprehensive integration guide (`docs/widget-integration-guide.md`) that explains how to implement the widget in various environments, with troubleshooting tips.

### 3. Updated Site Wizard Modal

We've updated the Site Wizard Modal to use the new integration options component instead of showing only a single code snippet.

## Benefits

- **Framework Flexibility**: Users can now install the widget in their preferred framework without having to adapt the code themselves.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Clear instructions for each framework improve the developer experience.
- **Reduced Support Burden**: More detailed integration options should lead to fewer support questions about installation.
- **Mobile/App Considerations**: The direct link option provides a simpler way to integrate in certain environments.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider creating framework-specific npm packages (e.g., `@helpninja/react`, `@helpninja/vue`, etc.)
2. Add widget customization options (colors, position, text)
3. Provide SDK documentation for programmatic interaction with the widget
4. Add more integration options for mobile apps and other platforms

## Testing Suggestions

- Test the widget integration in each supported framework
- Verify that the code snippets work correctly
- Test with domain verification to ensure proper security checks
- Test in development and production environments
