This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Embeddable widget

Embed HelpNinja on any site:

```html
<script async src="https://your-site.com/api/widget?t=TENANT_PUBLIC_KEY&voice=friendly"></script>
```

Notes:
- The `t` param is your tenant public key from Dashboard â†’ Settings.
- The widget posts to `/api/chat`; the API resolves the provided key to the internal tenant UUID (supports public_key, secret_key, or slug) before DB access.
- If the key is unknown, the API returns `{ error: 'tenant_not_found' }` with 400, never a 500.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
